## 🚀 **How to Run ByteBouncer:**

### **🟢 Normal Launch (Most Files):**

# Easy methods:
run_bytebouncer.bat      # Double-click this
run_bytebouncer.ps1      # PowerShell version

# Manual method:
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

### **🔴 Administrator Launch (System Files):**
```batch
# Easy methods:
run_as_admin.bat         # Double-click for admin mode
run_as_admin.ps1         # PowerShell admin version

# The app will show "🛡️ Admin" status when running as administrator
```

## 🎮 **Using Administrator Features:**

### **In the App Interface:**
1. **Check Admin Status** - Look for:
   - `🛡️ Admin` = Running as Administrator
   - `👤 User` = Running as regular user

2. **Need Admin Rights?** - Click:
   - `🔓 Run as Admin` = Restart with admin privileges

3. **Permission Errors?** - ByteBouncer will:
   - Show detailed error explanations
   - Offer to restart as administrator
   - Provide specific solutions

### **File Operation Workflow:**
```
1. 📊 Scan directory
2. ✓ Select files to delete
3. 🔍 Check Selected - see which need admin
4. 🛡️ If admin needed: Click "Run as Admin" 
5. 🗑️ Delete Selected - now with admin privileges
```

## 🔍 **Admin vs User Comparison:**

| Operation | User Mode | Admin Mode |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **User Files** | ✅ Can delete | ✅ Can delete |
| **System Files** | ❌ Permission denied | ✅ Can delete |
| **Program Files** | ❌ Permission denied | ✅ Can delete |
| **Windows Folder** | ❌ Permission denied | ⚠️ Can delete (dangerous!) |
| **Temp Files** | ✅ Own files only | ✅ All temp files |

## ⚠️ **Safety Warnings:**

### **Administrator Mode Cautions:**
- 🚨 **Can delete critical system files** - Be very careful!
- 🛡️ **ByteBouncer shows warnings** for dangerous files
- 🗑️ **All files still go to Recycle Bin** - can be recovered
- 🔍 **Always use "Check Selected" first** in admin mode

### **Recommended Practice:**
1. **Start in User Mode** - Delete regular files first
2. **Use Admin Mode only** when you get permission errors
3. **Read all warnings** before deleting system files
4. **Keep backups** of important data

## 🎯 **Quick Start Guide:**

### **For Regular Files (Documents, Downloads, etc.):**
```batch
# Just double-click:
run_bytebouncer.bat
```

### **For System Files or Protected Files:**
```batch
# Double-click for admin mode:
run_as_admin.bat
```

### **Virtual Environment Issues:**
- ✅ **All launch scripts handle this automatically**
- ✅ **Look for (venv) in terminal prompt**
- ✅ **Scripts will show error if venv fails**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **"Can't delete file" Issues:**
1. **Check admin status** in app (🛡️ Admin vs 👤 User)
2. **Use "🔍 Check Selected"** to see what's needed
3. **Click "🔓 Run as Admin"** if permission denied
4. **Close programs** using locked files first

### **Virtual Environment Issues:**
```batch
# Manual fix:
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python app.py

# Or use the launch scripts - they handle it automatically
```

- ✅ **Right-click launch script** → "Run as Administrator"
